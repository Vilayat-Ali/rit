# Rit 

Rit is a non-professional git version control system implementation in pure rust. It's definitely not for **serious business stuff**. But instead meant for educational means `ONLY`. 

The single most important reason why this even exists is - Because I wanted to learn Git. And what's better to learn about git internals than to implement one by yourself in your favourite programming language.
